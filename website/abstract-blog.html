									<p>It is alarming that 55% of Indians in 2017 were pushed into poverty due to out-of-pocket medical expenses. Data on quality and accreditation of diagnostic establishments in the country have been described as scanty by many surveys conducted. These statistics are damaging considering the pernicious effects of Covid-19. The pandemic has left millions in disarray and the mounting pressure on the healthcare system isnâ€™t helping either. The population has succumbed to the fear of contracting the virus and many people make false assumptions based on their symptoms. Our goal is to get rid of these problems by attacking one major part of healthcare, diagnosis

								<p>Breast Cancer has been a long standing issue which has been plaguing humans world-wide every single day. We are grateful to have this opportunity to work on a social cause and try to provide a solution. We have always looked at the problem at hand and tried to solve it pragmatically. Any solution provided to the society adds to the measures that can taken to get through impediments. We have come up with 2 predictive models which have performed very well according to the metrics we have considered. In the future, this system can be implemented in a wide scale in every health centre. Since the disease is omnipresent, the challenge of scalability is one issue we can not afford to put on the backburner. </p>
								<p>It has to be developed in such a way that the database is ever increasing and the servers are able to handle it. We are positive that this product can be brought out for use in health centres as per the requirements of the demographic. We thank everyone who has guided us in this endeavor in pursuit of a solution for detecting breast cancer early
                </p>
